# Graphi

## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript boilerplate repository.

This boilerplate is based on:

  - Mongoose (MongoDB)
  - GraphQL API (Apollo)
  - CQRS (event-driven)
  - JWT Authentication
  - A simple user module
  - A simple user validation process (email module implementation) that probably needs more work to make sense

## Requirements

  - NodeJS
  - Redis
  - MongoDB

## ToDoList

  - Make MailModule with a strategy pattern to give it more sense
  - separate modules whenever it may make sense
  - Authentication and policy based permissions (flexibility per module)
  - [add new idea here]
